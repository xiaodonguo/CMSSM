# Cross-modal State Space Model for Real-time RGB-Thermal Wild Scene Semantic Segmentation
## Introduction
For the convenience of the review process, we have built a repository demo containing the code for the paper "Cross-modal State Space Model for Real-time RGB-Thermal Wild Scene Semantic Segmentation," submitted to IROS 2025. A more polished and complete version of the repository will be updated upon the acceptance of the paper.
