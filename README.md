# Cross-modal State Space Modeling for Real-time RGB-Thermal Wild Scene Semantic Segmentation
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the paper "Cross-modal State Space Modeling for Real-time RGB-Thermal Wild Scene Semantic Segmentation," which has been accepted by IROS 2025.
**Updating** âœ¨: An extended version of our conference paper has been submitted to TCSVT. More details and codes can be found [here](your-link-here).
## Method 
![picture1](./fig/fig2.png)
The CM-SSM consists of two image encoders to extract the features of RGB and thermal images, four CM-SSA moudules to perform RGB-T feature fusion in four stages, and an MLP decoder to predict the semantic segmentation maps.

The CM-SS2D consists of three steps: 1) cross-modal selective scanning, 2) cross-modal state space modeling and 3) scan merging.
